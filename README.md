🔧 Project Name: Email Spam Classifier Using Machine Learning

📌 Objective

To classify emails as spam or not spam (ham) using natural language processing (NLP) techniques and machine learning algorithms.

🧰 Tools & Libraries

Python

Pandas

NumPy

Scikit-learn

NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit)

Matplotlib / Seaborn (for visualization)

📁 Dataset

Use the classic SpamAssassin dataset or SMS Spam Collection dataset from UCI:

Dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/sms-spam-collection-dataset

🧪 Optional Enhancements

Use other models: SVM, RandomForest, Logistic Regression

Add text cleaning: Remove punctuation, lemmatize using nltk

Save model with joblib or pickle for reuse

Build a Flask or Streamlit web app to classify new emails

🎯 Conclusion

You've now built a working email spam classifier! You can deploy it as a web service or integrate it into email clients or apps for real-world uses.
